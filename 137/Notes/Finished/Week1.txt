The range in voltage determines boolean values.

Volts
5
		} "1" True 2.4v to 5v
_

		} "0" False 0v to 0.8v

Types of numbers:
	Floating Point Numbers 
		->Foaat 32 bits, double 64 bits
	Signed numbers
		->in signed we have 2's complement, and signed magnitude
	Unsigned numbers
		->binary

unsigned

0 0 0
0 0 1
0 1 0
0 1 1
1 0 0
1 0 1
1 1 0
1 1 1
Can store up to 7
range [0 - 7]

2s Complement

the first column is a signed bit position
|
V

0 0 0 | 0
0 0 1 | 1
0 1 0 | 2
0 1 1 | 3
1 0 0 |-4
1 0 1 |-3
1 1 0 |-2
1 1 1 |-1

Can store [-4,3]


signed magnitude
the first column is a signed bit position
|
V
0 0 0 +0
0 0 1 +1
0 1 0 +2
0 1 1 +3

1 0 0 -0
1 0 1 -1
1 1 0 -2
1 1 1 -3

Only application of this is in the floating point number representation


4-bit 2s complement

(-5) = (0101)
First put in binary form.
Then flip the bits and add one
(1010)
+   1
_____
(1011) = -5 in twos complement
Now to go from twos to decimal
Flip Bits + 1
(0100)
+   1
_____
(0101) Same procedure for both.

I/O Are part of memory, they are addresses just like memory address, but they refer to specifics such as addresses
When variables are assigned, they are assigned to an address

Embedded System is like phones, it uses firmware and is fixed code.
An operatiing system is NOT embedded. It lives on the disk. Firmware is software written on chips for a specific purpose.

Digital Logic Design

MOS circuits only use power when it is being switched, while others are always on.
CMOS is complementating MOS transistors. This is effective becuase it reduces power consum[tion and head dissipation. 

CMOS chips can be fan-cooled when hot.
This enabled personal computers.
Exclusively used today in all types of digital systems

We require a minimum logic circuits.
Logic circuits implement logic expressions all nand pr all nor gates whoe implentatation details.
Two types od digital curctuis.

1. Combinational: Outputs are genderated concurrently.

E.g Adders and selectors.

Sequential: Outputs are generated in sequence.
Output depends on current inputs as well as previous inputs. Uses combinational circuits to generate outputs. Registers counter and control units

sequential has a clock signal
clock signal _-_-_-_-_-_-_-_

THe problem we face today with processing capablilities is heat dissapation.
It is simply too much heat. Our current solutions include multithreading, more proceessore, and thread-level parallelism

for every input you need one transistor
