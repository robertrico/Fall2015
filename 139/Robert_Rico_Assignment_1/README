#### Description #########
This project implements the use of a bounded buffer between two processes, a producer, and a consumer process.Using shared memory the producer 
process creates a shared memory object, using the libshm library which was created by code provided.
It then inserts a random integer into the buffer at the in index.
The consumer then consumes the integer at the out index. The out index is incremented if the buffer is not empty, while the in index incremented if the
buffer is not full.

#### Compliation #########
To Compile simply use the make file, it will compile the libary as well as the code

#### Execution #########
To run execute producer with arguments from bin, or use the provided executable script file called run
